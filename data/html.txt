HTML Setup
===========
Recall that an HTML document must always start by specifying the DOCTYPE. 
The entire content is then enclosed within an <html> tag. 
Within this tag, the content is further segregated into either the <head> or <body> elements of the code. 
The <head> tag contains all the metadata about the page, 
and the <body> tag contains the content that is displayed to the end user.

As per this setup, an empty HTML document without content or metadata should look as follows:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Metadata goes here -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content goes here -->
    </body>
</html>


Adding Text
The <p> tag should be used to insert text into your HTML document. This element stands for paragraph and includes any text content, whether it is a single word or a 10-page essay.



Add Links to Other Pages : 
Web pages can link to other pages or other places on the same page via a hyperlink. The <a> tag defines a hyperlink in HTML, followed by the href attribute to define the destination address of the hyperlink.
Hyperlinks are normally inserted into text so that when you click some hyperlinked text, it takes you to the destination.
